#Monk loves to preform different operations on arrays, and so being the principal of Hackerearth School, he assigned a task to his new student Mishki. Mishki will be provided with an integer array A of size N and an integer K , where she needs to rotate the array in the right direction by K steps and then print the resultant array. As she is new to the school, please help her to complete the task.

def array(N):
    a=[]
    for i in range(N):
        e = int(input("element"))
        a.append(e)
    return a
T=int(input())
while(T>0):
    a = []
    N = int(input())
    K = int(input())
    a=array(N)
    aa=(a[len(a)-K:len(a)]+a[0:len(a)-K])
    T=T-1
print(aa)
